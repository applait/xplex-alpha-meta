import Xplex from '@components/Xplex.astro';

## How does it work?

At its core, <Xplex /> is an [rtmp-enabled](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module) [nginx server](http://nginx.org/) that splits & pushes incoming RTMP streams to one or more pre-configured RTMP endpoints.

It also provides a simple web-based dashboard with REST API &mdash; called <Xplex isHQ="true" /> &mdash; to conveniently manage the ingest URLs.
