## Objective Abstract

At its core, <Xplex /> is an [rtmp-enabled](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module) [nginx server](http://nginx.org/) that pushes identical copies of incoming RTMP streams to one or more pre-configured RTMP endpoints.

It also provides a simple web-based dashboard with REST API &mdash; called <Xplex isHQ /> &mdash; to conveniently manage the ingest URLs.

## Design Principles

<summary>Effective</summary>
make it do what it's supposed to do

<details>
<summary>Efficient</summary>
do it with minimal teleological overhead
</details>
<details>
<summary>Elegant</summary>
and with fluent grace of pieces falling in place

<details>
<summary>Extensible</summary>
while leaving room for progressive enhancements

## Repository Overview

<FileTree>

- .github/ ---> actions & workflows automations
- app/ -------> source files for <Xplex isHQ /> server
- conf/ ------> nginx configs for HTTP & RTMP
- docs/ ------> website with landing page & docs
- .gitignore
- Dockerfile -> containerization instructions
- **LICENSE** ---> source is available under **MPLv2.0**
- README.md
- setup.sh ---> <Xplex /> manual setup script
- xplex.sh ---> <Xplex /> container startup script

</FileTree>

## Operational Steps

- **There's no official `nginx-rtmp` container; so first, we built one from scratch.**
  - You can build it by explicitly mentioning the target as `nginx` instead of `xplex` as the default target; e.g. `docker build --target nginx -t xplex/nginx .`
- **Next up we implant the `nginx-rtmp` installation on a Node.js base image.**
  - This is simpler than installing Node.js on the `nginx-rtmp` image.
  - We may want to move out or refactor Node.js dependency in future.
- **Then we apply configurations for the HTTP & RTMP servers.**
  - The HTTP server reverse proxies the <Xplex /> server to run on port 8080 to port 80.
  - Reverse proxying is not functionally necessary for the setup to work (API or stream).
  - But accessing dashboard over port 80 the easiest way to validate nginx build success.
- **Then we install <Xplex isHQ /> as a simple Node.js app to manage the ingest URLs**
- **Finally, we start the processes inside the container in sequence**
  - The Node.js server is started first & sent to background
  - Then the nginx process is started with daemon mode off

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] <Xplex isHQ /> improvements
- [ ] Let's Encrypt integration
- [ ] Unit & integration tests
- [ ] x86, ARM, RISC-V support

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] RTMPS support
- [ ] RTSP support
- [ ] SRT support
- [ ] HLS support
- [ ] NDI support
- [ ] ...and more
