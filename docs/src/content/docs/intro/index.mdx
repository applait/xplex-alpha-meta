#### <Xplex /> is your personal, open source, multi-streaming server to ***simultaneously stream to as many platforms as you want to***.

---

## What does it do?

<Xplex /> acts as a bridge between your streaming software (e.g. OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS, XSplit etc.) and the streaming services (e.g. Twitch, YouTube etc.). It takes the stream from your streaming software and goes live on all of the streaming services you've asked it to &mdash; **all at once**!

:::note[Think of it this way...]
Imagine <Xplex /> is an HDMI splitter. You connect your streaming software to <Xplex /> (like you connect your HDMI source to the splitter), and <Xplex /> forwards the stream to multiple streaming services (like the splitter forwards the video to multiple screens).
:::

## Who is it for?

<Xplex /> is for content creators who want to reach a wider audience by simultaneously streaming to multiple platforms, without costly subscriptions or complicated setups, while retaining full control of the choice, flexibility, extensibility & the data.

For now, it takes running at least an oneliner command in a terminal to make it work; so you could say it's for technically adept streamers.

:::caution[Stay tuned!]
We are working on getting the need for CLI commands down to zero. At which point, <Xplex /> is for anybody who want to multi-stream without a headache.
:::

## Where does it run?

Ideally you would want to setup <Xplex /> on a cloud server with good network bandwidth, so it can handle multiple streams. But you can also run it on your local machine, or on a homelab server.

:::tip[Compute & Complexity]
There's no transcoding involved, so not only the stream quality remains the same as what you're sending from your streaming software, but there's no significant overhead on the server either. You can run <Xplex /> even on the lowest-end VM/VPS that cloud providers have to offer.
:::

## How much does it cost?

<Xplex /> is **free and open source software**. You can run it on your own home server, or use a cloud server to host it. The only cost you would incur is the server cost; and the exact value depends on your cloud provider and their pricing of the compute unit of your choice.

:::note[Choosing Cloud Host]
Here's a price comparison of cheapest compute units provided by some popular cloud providers:
| Cloud Host   | Compute      | Bandwidth | Cost/month | Referral Link |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| DigitalOcean | 1core, 0.5GB | 500GB     | $4         | [$200 starting credit](https://m.do.co/c/97a76c3ca7ad)         |
| Linode       | 1core, 1.0GB | 1000GB    | $5         | Coming Soon                                                    |
| Vultr        | 1core, 0.5GB | 500GB     | $2.5       | [$10 starting credit](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9638716)      |

Either of them should be a good option; however, the author has only extensively used & tested DigitalOcean. If you face any quirk or edge case on the other servers, please [let us know](https://github.com/debloper/xplex/issues/new).

:::tip[Free Test Run]
By using the referral links to sign up, you'll receive ample credits to explore `xplex` for a couple of months at no cost to you.

While we have no affiliation with the mentioned cloud providers, should you choose to continue their services after the credits expire and spend a small amount ($25 on DO, $10 on Vultr), we'll receive an one-time cloud credit of the same value.

There's no obligation, but your support would make a meaningful contribution to the project.
