title: Set up Streaming Software
description: A comprehensive guide on how to setup streaming software for xplex.

import Xplex from '@components/Xplex.astro';
import { Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
1. **Set Streaming Endpoint**

   Open your streaming software (e.g. OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS, XSplit etc.) and from its settings/preferences, update the streaming endpoint to the <Xplex /> ingest URL. The URL should look something like:

   ```
   rtmp://<hostname-or-IP>:1935/live
   ```

   As an example, if your <Xplex isHQ="true" /> server is running on `http://192.168.0.100/`, the URL should be `rtmp://192.168.0.100:1935/live`; or if it's running on `http://xplex.example.com`, the URL should be `rtmp://xplex.example.com:1935/live`.

   :::note[For Mandatory Stream Key]
   If the software has two separate fields for `server URL` & `stream key` and won't let you keep the `stream key` field blank, then put the <Xplex /> ingest endpoint in the `server URL` field & any URL-safe random string in the `stream key` field (e.g. `1234` or `asdf`).
   
   <Xplex /> will ignore the `stream key`, and just use the `server URL` for routing.

2. **Review Encoding Settings**

   Make sure the encoding settings is supported by all the streaming service(s) you're targeting.

   <details>
   <summary>Use the lowest common denominator for encoding settings:</summary>
   As an example, YouTube supports 4K@60fps stream; but if you're also streaming to Twitch or Facebook, which doesn't support 4K, you'll have to stream at 1080p or lower. If you're also planning to stream to ùïè, which does support 1080p/FHD, but doesn't support 60fps, you'll have to stream at 30fps.
   </details>

   :::tip[Rule of Thumb]
   For maximum compatibility, it's recommended to stream at 1080p@30fps with a bitrate of 5000 Kbps.

3. **Run a Test Stream**

   Before going live, run a test stream to make sure everything is working as expected.

   Different platforms have different ways to test stream without going live, so check their platform documentation for specific details.

   :::note[Example with Twitch]
   Twitch allows you to test stream without going live, by using **`?bandwidthtest=true`** parameter. The URL should look like `rtmp://{LOC##}.contribute.live-video.net/app/{live_0000000_xxxxxxxxxxxx}?bandwidthtest=true`.

   You will have to update <Xplex isHQ="true" /> with this URL before starting test stream. Make sure to remove **`?bandwidthtest=true`** parameter from the ingest URL before going live.
