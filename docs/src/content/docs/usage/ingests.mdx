<Steps>
1. **Get ingest URLs**

   Visit streaming services' dashboard(s) and note down the streaming endpoints & stream-keys.

   :::danger[Attention]
   Make sure to not share these keys with anyone, as they can be used by someone else to impersonate you & stream content to your account.
   :::

   <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Twitch" icon="twitch">
      Visit Twitch's [ingest endpoint recommendation page](https://help.twitch.tv/s/twitch-ingest-recommendation) to discover the apt ingest server for your location, and checkout [stream key FAQ](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/twitch-stream-key-faq) for latest details on how to get your stream key.

      A typical Twitch ingest endpoint should look something like:

      ```bash
      rtmp://{LOC##}.contribute.live-video.net/app/{live_0000000_xxxxxxxxxxxx}
      ```

      The `{LOC##}` is the server location code, e.g. `del01` for Delhi, India. This may (and likely will) be different for you, depending on your ISP location & latency. The `{live_0000000_xxxxxxxxxxxx}` is the stream key and it's unique to your account.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="YouTube" icon="youtube">
      Please visit [YouTube's Live Dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard) to get your ingest endpoint & stream key.

      A typical YouTube ingest endpoint should look something like:

      ```bash
      rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/{####-####-####-####-####}
      ```

      YouTube's ingest URL should be the same for everyone, but still check your account to make sure. The `{####-####-####-####-####}` part is your stream key.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Others" icon="external">
      <Xplex /> supports all RTMP-based streaming services, so you can use it with any service that provides an RTMP ingest URL like this:

      ```bash
      rtmp://{ingest-server}/{application-path}/{unique-key}
      ```

      :::note[Something Missing?]
      If any popular streaming service requires specific instructions, and should be added to this section for clarity, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/debloper/xplex/issues/new).

   </Tabs>

2. **Add Ingest URLs**

   Put each of your ingest URLs in the `"Add new ingest URL"` field in <Xplex isHQ="true" /> dashboard and click `"Add Ingest"` button (or press `<enter>`). Make sure the URLs are properly formatted, doesn't contain any extra characters or spaces, and the stream key is correct.

   :::note[Tip]
   You can remove any wrong/expired ingest URL by clicking the `"x"` button next to it.
   :::

3. **Apply Changes**
   
   Once you're done adding all the outgoing ingests, click `"Apply Changes"` to commit it to the <Xplex /> server. This will reload the new configuration in the running <Xplex /> container.

   It's instantaneous and you can immediately start streaming to all the services you've added.

</Steps>

Next up, you need to setup your streaming software. Head over to the [streaming software setup](/usage/streaming) to learn how to configure OBS, XSplit, or any other streaming software to stream to <Xplex />.
