import Xplex from '@components/Xplex.astro';
import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Regardless of the installation mechanism you went with, once you're done with the setup, you should be able to verify its success by accessing the `http://<hostname-or-IP>/` URL from your browser.

:::danger[Note]
If you're unable to access the <Xplex isHQ="true" /> dashboard, please check the [setup guide](/setup) if you've missed anything, or [file an issue](https://github.com/debloper/xplex/issues/new) for help.
:::

If you can see the <Xplex isHQ="true" /> dashboard - it means that the internal components of <Xplex /> are working correctly - you're now all set to configure your ingest endpoints.

Just follow the next steps to go live with multi-streaming.
