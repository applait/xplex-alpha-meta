import Xplex from '@components/Xplex.astro';
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This is **not the recommended way to setup <Xplex />** (even as a developer environment), but if you're feeling adventurous&mdash;to build and deploy it without containerization, then here's how to do it.

## Install Dependencies

Depending on the package manager the host system uses, the package names & the commands to install them will vary; please use the appropriate section below:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="APT">
    If you're on a Debian-based system, using [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)) as package manager (e.g. Ubuntu, OpenMediaVault, Linux Mint etc.) then run:

    ```bash
    # update installed packages
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    # install build dependencies
    sudo apt install -y build-essential git nodejs npm
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="DNF">
    If you're on a Fedora-based system, using [DNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNF_(software)) as package manager (e.g. RHEL, CentOS, Alma, Rocky, Amazon Linux etc.) then run:

    ```bash
    # update installed packages
    sudo dnf update
    # install build dependencies
    sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ git make nodejs nodejs-npm perl wget
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Others">
    If you've chosen to use a system that uses some different & obscure package manager, then you already know what you're doing and don't need hand holding to prepare for the build.

    Just make sure to update installed packages and then install the build dependencies.

    Here's a generic (and likely non-exhaustive) list of dependencies you may need:
    - gcc & g++
    - git & wget
    - make & autoconf
    - perl & perl-modules
    - nodejs & nodejs-npm

    Good luck!

:::caution[Just in Case]
If you end up installing additional packages for a successful build, please [let us know](https://github.com/debloper/xplex/issues).

## Download Code

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Git">
    If you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed, you can clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/debloper/xplex.git
    cd xplex
    git checkout v1.0.0
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Zip">
    If you don't have Git installed, you can download the code as a ZIP archive:

    ```bash
    # avoid using latest development code, as it may be unstable
    # make sure to download archive of the latest tagged version
    # from https://github.com/debloper/xplex/tags - for exmaple:
    wget https://github.com/debloper/xplex/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip
    unzip v1.0.0.zip
    cd xplex-1.0.0
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Tar">
    If you don't have Git installed, and instead of ZIP, you prefer TAR archives:

    ```bash
    # avoid using latest development code, as it may be unstable
    # make sure to download archive of the latest tagged version
    # from https://github.com/debloper/xplex/tags - for exmaple:
    wget https://github.com/debloper/xplex/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.tar.gz
    tar -xzf v1.0.0.tar.gz
    cd xplex-1.0.0
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Run Setup Script

Inside the directory, there's a `setup.sh`, which automates the tasks to get <Xplex /> up and running:

```bash title="NOTE: audit the script before running it"
sudo ./setup.sh
# or, you can configure and run each of its commands separately.
```

:::note
Depending on the available compute resources, the build may take a few minutes to complete. On a VM with 4 modern CPU cores and 4GB RAM, it takes about 2-3 minutes.
:::


## Manage Firewall Rules

<Xplex /> uses port `80` for HTTP & port `1935` for RTMP. Please make sure the [firewall on the host system is configured](/ref/manage/firewall) to allow traffic on these ports.


## Access the Dashboard

Open a browser & access your <Xplex isHQ /> dashboard at `http://<hostname-or-IP>/`. If you can see the dashboard, then <Xplex /> is up and running & ready for the multi-streaming setup. ðŸŽ‰
