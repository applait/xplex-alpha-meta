Setting up multi-streaming with <Xplex /> is pretty straightforward. Some technical expertise will sure be handy, but the only thing you need in abundance is excitement & determination to see it through.

:::tip[Docs can be fun too!]
This guide is like an exploration adventure where you scoot along the terrain... sometimes coming to a fork of decision, and then make a choice to go with one that fits you the most.

You may not even be installing <Xplex /> at the moment&mdash;that doesn't mean you can't have fun!

**And if you just follow along the steps, you'll be up and live in no time!**

## Get a Host System

As a self hosted service, <Xplex /> needs a ***host*** to run. By that we mean it needs a computer&mdash;albeit small or cheap; but with an operating system &mdash;to run on.

If this is super obvious to you; and you've already decided on a host that's ready to go, then you can skip ahead to the next steps. But if you're new to this, then here's a guide to get you started:

## Run Preliminary Checks

Before you start the setup process (especially if you're going with an existing homelab or cloud server with other services running on it, or maybe even on a new system with preinstalled software on it) you should ensure that the host system is ready to run it. This includes checking:

- if you have root access
- if there's no existing nginx service running, and
- if the required ports are available & not blocked by firewall.

Again, if you're already familiar with these checks, then you can skip ahead to the next steps. But if you're new to this, then here's a guide to get you started:

## Choose Your Adventure

Brace yourself, <Badge text="you're all set" /> to install <Xplex /> and there are two ways to go on about it:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Recommended" icon="seti:docker">
    <LinkCard
      title="Run it with Docker"
      description="The easiest, one-and-done way to get started with <b>xplex</b>."
      href="/setup/docker"
    />
  </Card>
  <Card title="Are you sure?" icon="linux">
    <LinkCard
      title="Setup & run it manually"
      description="For complete control & flexibility, at the cost of convenience."
      href="/setup/native"
    />
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

The recommend method (using Docker) will take **altogether 5-10min** to set it all up... and that's including signing up to a [cloud provider](/intro#how-much-does-it-cost). Whereas the manual method will take considerably longer (from 30min to a few hours), depending on your hardware and software environment.

But for some reason, if you **really need** to customize or rebuild <Xplex />'s internal components&mdash;either to fit your specific requirements or to set up a development environment&mdash;then you may want to manually build and install it. The guide is there only to point you towards the right direction; but if you're taking this path, then hopefully you know what you're doing.
