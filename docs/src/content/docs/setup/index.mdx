Setting up multi-streaming with <Xplex /> is pretty straightforward. This guide is designed as an exploration game where you scoot along the terrain, then sometimes come to a fork of decision, and then make a choice to go with one that fits you the most.

Technical expertise will definitely be helpful, but as long as you are excited & determined to see it through, lack of it shouldn't hold you back.

**Just follow along the steps, and you'll be up and live in no time!**

## Get a Host System

As a self hosted service, <Xplex /> needs a ***host*** to run. By that we mean it needs a computer&mdash;albeit small or cheap and with an operating system &mdash;to run on.

If this is super obvious to you; and you've already deciden on a host that's ready to go, then you can skip ahead to the next steps. But if you're new to this, then here's a guide to get you started:

## Run Preliminary Checks

Before you start the setup process (especially if you're going with an existing homelab or cloud server with other services running on it, or maybe even on a new system with preinstalled software on it) you should ensure that the host system is ready to run it. This includes checking:

- if you have root access
- if there's no existing nginx service running, and
- if the required ports are available & not blocked by firewall.

Again, if you're already familiar with these checks, then you can skip ahead to the next steps. But if you're new to this, then here's a guide to get you started:

## Choose Your Adventure

Brace yourself, <Badge text="you're all set" /> to install <Xplex /> and there are two ways to go on about it:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Recommended" icon="seti:docker">
    <LinkCard
      title="Run it with Docker"
      description="The easiest, one-and-done way to get started with <b>xplex</b>."
      href="/setup/docker"
    />
  </Card>
  <Card title="Are you sure?" icon="linux">
    <LinkCard
      title="Setup & run it manually"
      description="For complete control & flexibility, at the cost of convenience."
      href="/setup/native"
    />
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

The recommend method (using Docker) is especially more effective, efficient & elegant, if you're using a cloud provider that offers ready to use system image with Docker preinstalled. Otherwise, you'll have to install Docker first.

But for some reason, if you **really need** to customize or rebuild <Xplex />'s internal components, then you may want to manually build and install it. The guide is there only to point you towards the right direction; but if you're taking this path, then hopefully you know what you're doing.
