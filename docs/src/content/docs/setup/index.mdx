Setting up multi-streaming with <Xplex /> can be simpler than configuring a streaming software; or it can be a poster-child of the stereotypical CLI obsessed Linux user experience... YOU decide!

### Choose your adventure

For now, there are only two ways to deploy <Xplex />:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Recommended" icon="seti:docker">
    <LinkCard
      title="Run it with Docker"
      description="The easiest, one-and-done way to get started with <b>xplex</b>."
      href="/setup/docker"
    />
  </Card>
  <Card title="Are you sure?" icon="linux">
    <LinkCard
      title="Setup & run it manually"
      description="For complete control & flexibility, at the cost of convenience."
      href="/setup/native"
    />
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

The recommend method (using Docker) is especially more effective, efficient & elegant, if you're using a cloud provider that offers ready to use system image with Docker preinstalled. Otherwise, you'll have to install Docker first.

Just follow along the steps, and you'll be up and live in no time!

But for some reason, if you **really need** to customize or rebuild <Xplex />'s internal components, then you may want to manually build and install it. The guide is there only to point you towards the right direction; but if you're taking this path, then hopefully you know what you're doing.
