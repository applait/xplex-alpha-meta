Setting up multi-streaming with <Xplex /> is simpler than configuring a streaming software like OBS or XSplitâ€”even when using the [fully manual setup](/setup/native) mode.

However, for most users, we recommend deploying <Xplex /> using [Docker containers](/setup/docker). This method is not only easier but also far more effective, efficient & elegant. If you don't need to customize or rebuild <Xplex />'s internal components (i.e. most of you), then this is the fastest way to get started.

Just follow along the steps, and you'll be up and live in no time!
