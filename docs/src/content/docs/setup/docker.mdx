In order to run <Xplex /> as a Docker container, first you need to ensure:
- [ ] You have root access on the system.
- [ ] You have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system.
- [ ] There's no existing **nginx** service running on the system.
- [ ] Port `80 (HTTP)` and `1935 (RTMP)` are available & not blocked by firewall.

Once you've verified all of the above, you're good to go!
