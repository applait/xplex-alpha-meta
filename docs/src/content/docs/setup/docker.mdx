:::note[Prerequisites' Checklist]
To run <Xplex /> as a Docker container, you'll need to ensure that:
- [ ] You have root access on the system.
- [ ] You have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system.
- [ ] There's no existing **nginx** service running on the system.
- [ ] Port `80` (HTTP) and `1935` (RTMP) are available & not blocked by firewall.

Once you've verified all of the above, you're good to go!
:::

<Steps>

1. **Run the <Xplex /> container**

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name xplex -p 80:80 -p 1935:1935 xplex/xplex
   ```

2. **Mark it DONE on your TODO list**

   No, really... That's it! You're done.

   You can now access your <Xplex isHQ="true" /> dashboard at `http://<hostname-or-IP>/`

</Steps>

:::caution[Check Firewall Rules]
If the host system is running a firewall, make sure to allow traffic on ports `80` (HTTP) & `1935` (RTMP). Follow [the firewall section](/setup/native#manage-firewall-rules) from manual installation guide to manage firewall.
