You may be running Docker for the first time today, but that doesn't mean it can't be fun!

If you went with the <Badge text="1-click setup option" variant="caution" /> with [Docker preinstalled system image](/setup/host#option-1-set-up-a-new-cloud-host)&mdash;then just skip the next queue of installing Docker and jump ahead to the [interesting bit](/setup/docker#run-the-docker-container) below.

## Install Docker

Installing Docker can be quite an involved process; especially considering all the platform and architecture variants it has to cover. It's best to follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) as it's canonical & comprehensive&mdash;covering all the supported platforms.

But for the most likely scenario of **installing Docker on a Debian based system**... in short:

<Steps>

1. <details>
   <summary>Update the package index & install certs</summary>
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ca-certificates curl
   ```
   </details>
2. <details>
   <summary>Add Docker's official GPG key</summary>
   ```bash
   sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
   sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
   sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
   ```
   </details>
3. <details>
   <summary>Add Docker repository to sources list</summary>
   ```bash
   echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   sudo apt update
   ```
   </details>
4. <details>
   <summary>Install Docker & its supporting package</summary>
   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
   ```
   </details>
5. <details>
   <summary>Start Docker service & enable on boot</summary>
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```
   </details>
6. <details>
   <summary>Verify installation by running container</summary>
   ```bash
   docker --version
   sudo docker run hello-world
   ```
   </details>

</Steps>

If you're new to all this and this seems a bit overwhelming; that's understandable.

Which is why, <Badge text="we recommend" variant="caution" /> going with a [system image with Docker preinstalled](/setup/host#option-1-set-up-a-new-cloud-host).


## Check Firewall Rules

If the host is running a firewall, make sure to allow traffic on ports `80` (HTTP) & `1935` (RTMP). Follow [the firewall section](/setup/native#manage-firewall-rules) from manual installation guide to manage firewall if you need.


## Run the Docker Container

<Steps>

1. ```bash title="Run the xplex container"
   docker run -d --name xplex -p 80:80 -p 1935:1935 xplex/xplex
   ```

2. Open a browser & access your <Xplex isHQ /> dashboard at `http://<hostname-or-IP>/`
