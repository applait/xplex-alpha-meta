If you went with the <Badge text="1-click setup" variant="caution" /> option with [Docker preinstalled](/refs/choose/clouds) system image on a cloud instance&mdash;then skip the next sections and jump ahead to the [interesting bit](/setup/docker#run-the-docker-container) down below.

## Requirements

<Steps>

1. [**Verify superuser access**](/refs/check/superuser)
2. [**Ensure Docker is installed**](/refs/check/docker)
3. [**Look out for conflicting nginx**](/refs/check/nginx)
4. [**Confirm required ports are free**](/refs/check/ports)

</Steps>


## Configure Firewall

If the host is running a firewall, make sure to allow traffic on ports `80` (HTTP) & `1935` (RTMP). Follow [the firewall guide](/refs/manage/firewall) to learn how to open ports on your system.


## Run the Docker Container

<Steps>

1. ```bash title="Run the xplex container"
   docker run -d --name xplex -p 80:80 -p 1935:1935 xplex/xplex
   ```

2. Open a browser & access your <Xplex isHQ /> dashboard at `http://<hostname-or-IP>/`

That's it... you now have a running <Xplex /> instance, which is ready for the multi-streaming setup.
