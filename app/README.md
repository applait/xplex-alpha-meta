# xplex<sup>HQ</sup>

This part of the code was written back in early 2019, by someone who absolutely wasn't into frontend, didn't need it and just did the bare minimum to get by (and barely ever used... as editing the `xplex.conf` in `/usr/local/nginx/conf/` & reloading `nginx` was perceived to be easier & more comprehensive).

This should be seriously redesigned and revamped; hopefully by a better frontend engineer. There are plenty of options (i.e. way more so than already overcrowded as it was back then) and still probably most of them are going to be a better option than how it is at the moment.

For version 1, let this be. If `xplex` gains any traction, then Version 2 deserves a better frontend.
